This is the Android portion of Paybble project.
To make it compile you will need :
1. PebbleKit project in IDE from Pebble sdk somewhere on your PC.
Add as library dependency.
2. It also uses gson-2.2.4.jar that should be put in libs folder
3. android-support-v4.jar is also there although i don't think it is needed.

Cheers!
